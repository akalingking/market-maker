    "## Appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Avellaneda-Stoikov** model's analytical solution is derived by formulating the market-making problem as a stochastic optimal control problem which is then solved using the **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman** (HJB) equation. The key steps involve defining the value function and solving the corresponding partial differential equation to find closed-form expressions for optimal bid and ask quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Setup\n",
    "The model makes several key assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exogenous Mid-Price**: The mid-price $S_{t}$ follows a Brownian motion:$dS_{t}=\\sigma dW_{t}$, where $\\sigma$ is volatility and $W_{t}$ is a Wiener process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limit Order Executions**: Market orders from other traders arrive as independent **Poisson** processes with intensity rates that depend on the distance $\\delta$ of the market maker's posted price from the mid-price. Specifically, the rates are often modeled as $\\lambda ^{b}(\\delta ^{b})=Ae^{-\\kappa \\delta ^{b}}$ for the bid and $\\lambda ^{a}(\\delta ^{a})=Ae^{-\\kappa \\delta ^{a}}$ for the ask, where $A$ and $\\kappa $ are positive parameters representing the liquidity and the price sensitivity of order flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Utility Maximization**: The market maker aims to maximize the expected exponential utility of their terminal wealth at a future time $T$, with $\\gamma$ being the risk aversion parameter. The utility function is typically $U(x)=-\\exp (-\\gamma x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate the HJB Equation**: The problem is set up as a continuous-time optimal control problem. The value function: $v(t,s,x,q)$, represents the maximum expected utility at time $t$, given the current mid-price $s$, wealth $x$, and inventory $q$. The HJB equation for this problem is a non-linear partial differential equation that incorporates the dynamics of the price, inventory, and wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply an Ansatz**: Due to the choice of the exponential utility function, the value function can be factored into a specific form, an ansatz, which simplifies the HJB equation. A common form is $v(t,s,x,q)=-\\exp (-\\gamma x)\\exp (-\\gamma u(t,s,q))$, which allows the HJB to be transformed into a simpler PDE for $u(t,s,q)$ that is independent of the wealth $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solve the Simplified PDE**: The transformed PDE is solved subject to terminal conditions (e.g., zero inventory penalty at time $T$ in the basic model). This often involves techniques like asymptotic expansion or numerical methods, but for the basic model, a closed-form solution is obtainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Derive Optimal Quotes**: The optimal bid and ask prices (or spreads) are derived from the first-order conditions of the HJB equation, which relate the rates of execution to the gradient of the value function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Solution\n",
    "The resulting analytical solutions provide formulas for the optimal bid and ask quotes. The optimal reservation price (the price at which the market maker is indifferent to buying or selling) is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "r(s,q,t)=s-q\\gamma \\sigma ^{2}(T-t)\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the reservation price adjusts based on the current inventory $q$, risk aversion $\\gamma$, volatility $\\sigma ^{2}$, and time remaining until the horizon $(T-t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal bid and ask prices are then set symmetrically around this reservation price, with an additional spread component that depends on the market order intensity parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{bid}^{*}=r(s,q,t)-\\delta ^{*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{ask}^{*}=r(s,q,t)+\\delta ^{*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal half-spread $\\delta ^{*}$ is a function of the model parameters, balancing the need to execute orders quickly against the desire for a wider spread to generate profit. "
